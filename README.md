- **Supabase Integration:** Used for scalable, cloud-based media storage.
- **Admin Analytics:** Track usage trends, reminders triggered, and system health in real-time.

## 🔁 Automation & Stability

- **Auto Email Sharing:** If a card isn’t manually shared, the system auto-sends it to the intended recipient on the event date.
- **Recurring Events:** Birthday and anniversary reminders repeat annually without manual effort.
- **Email Verification:** Only verified users can trigger event reminders.
- **Token Expiry & Renewal:** Shared card links are time-bound and can be regenerated securely.
- **Rate Limiting:** Public card views and API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse.
- **Automated Backups:** PostgreSQL database and media metadata are backed up regularly to secure cloud storage (e.g., Supabase or GitHub).
- **Health Monitoring:** `/health/` endpoint is pinged automatically via GitHub Actions or cron to detect system downtime.
- **Admin Error Dashboard:** View logged errors, failed jobs, and alerts in the Django admin.
- **Timezone-Aware Scheduling:** All reminders and emails are triggered respecting Indian Standard Time (UTC+5:30).
